# Project #1: Your First Application

### STEP 1: Read the Directions
1) Read **ALL** of the directions before you start. We will know...

### STEP 2: Pitch Your Project
Before you start any actual coding, you must meet with your Squad Leader for ~10 minutes to get your app idea approved. Prepare the following materials _before_ your meeting and put them in your README.md:
- **App Title**: Effieâ€™s Blackjack
- **App Description**: t will let the user play against the dealer. Flip a card, hit or stand, and keep score
- **API**: Card Deck: https://deckofcardsapi.com/
- **API Snippet**: {
    "success": true,
    "deck_id": "3p40paa87x90",
    "shuffled": true,
    "remaining": 52
}

- **Wireframes**:  
Mobile and computer, it will be landscape on phone to have the same layout. It will just be on a smaller scale on mobile

</p>

- **MVP**: 
Scoreboard for player and dealer
Reset button
The deck
Dealer card display
Player card display
Hit Button
Stand Button
Next hand button

- **Post-MVP**: 
Recommendation on whether to hit or stand
Save score
Add multiple players
Enter name form
The throw away pile

- **Goals**: 
Day 1: get comfortable with the api and add html and basic css
Day 2: Use api to shuffle deck and place cards in piles 
Day 3: Add logic to count points for each hand
Day 4: Add logic to check your hand vs  dealer's hand
Day 5: Get the scoreboard and next hand logic
Day 6: add post mvp goals
Day 7: make everything pretty and finish post mvp goals

### STEP 3: Make a New Repo
1. [Make a new github repo for your project](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/). DO NOT FORK THIS REPO. 
2. This new repo should be under your Enterprise github, not you personal account.
2. Make sure your new repo is set to "Public" and initialize it with a README.md file.
3. Send a link for your repository to your Squad Leader.
4. Clone this new repository down to your machine.
5. CD into the project directory and touch ```index.html```, ```style.css``` and ```script.js``` files.
6. Test a commit and push it to make sure everything is connected with ```git commit -m "first commit"```.

Note: Your repository should **not** be called `project-1`! Think of a name for your application, and then name your repository after your application. 

### STEP 4: &#x1F534; Build Your Project MVP â€” Mandatory To Pass

#### Your application must meet these requirements:

  1. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  1. Use Axios to make a request to an external data source and insert some of the retrieved data on to the DOM.
  1. Fulfill the build requirements you have specified in your MVP.
  1. Implement responsive design (i.e. it should be fully functional on desktop, tablet, mobile, etc), using at least 2 media  queries.
  1. Deployed to a site hosting service like [surge.sh](https://surge.sh/).
  1. Commits to github every day.
  1. A `README.md` file that contains your project worksheet, a link to your live, deployed site, and any neccessary installation instructions such as ```npm i```.

#### ðŸ“‹ List of APIs

Below is a non-exhaustive list of some free APIs you can use. There are _many_ APIs out there, however, so if you find one not on this list, feel free to use it. No matter what API you decide on, make sure you are able to successfully make a GET request before you commit to using it.

  1. Star Wars: https://swapi.co/
  1. Weather: https://openweathermap.org/api
  1. News: https://newsapi.org/
  1. Giphy: https://developers.giphy.com/
  1. Pokemon: http://pokeapi.co/
  1. Card Deck: https://deckofcardsapi.com/
  1. City of Chicago: https://data.cityofchicago.org/
  1. Beer: https://www.brewerydb.com/developers
  1. Chuck Norris: http://www.icndb.com/
  1. Rick and Morty: https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#rest
  
[This site](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis) lists a collection APIs as well. Take a look through their libraries and try to find one that interests you. Please note, however, that many APIs will require an authentication key, and some APIs require payment. We **highly suggest** using a free API for your first project dealing with one.

### STEP 5: &#x1F535; Ideas for Post-MVP - Not Mandatory
- Look into [localstorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) so you can save data to the user's browser 
- Add a second API.
- Add creative use of event listeners and UI interaction.
- Add animations.
- Get input from a UX student on how to make your app have intuitive UI and design.

### STEP 6: Technical Demonstration

All projects will be presented to the class.  Your presentation should:

* Be no longer than 5 minutes in length
* Show off all features of the app
* Explain the technical details
* Explain the technical challenges
* Explain which improvements you might make

Your presentation should **NOT**:
* Focus on what you didn't accomplish.

You will be sharing your project and your code.  Be prepared to answer questions from the instructors and other students.

Did you read all of the directions before starting? If so write `git commit -m "chill'n in the blizzard"` instead of `git commit -m "first commit"` for your first commit.

### Step 7: Signing Up for Help

1. Fill out Github issue ticket to completion. 
2. Sign up for a time and give 10 minutes heads to instructor. 
3. Include `issue` link and name in P1 Schedular: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DtDnf12tnO8gatsZ_Ftq1-zIEhiHv1ihxXFekPHYFpc/edit#gid=1031520631
